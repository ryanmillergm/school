# The take_turn method is the crux of this problem.
# The take_turn method takes a string representing the guess.
# It should create a new Turn object with the appropriate
# guess and Card. It should store this new Turn, as well as
# return it from the take_turn method. Also, when the
# take_turn method is called, the Round should move on to
# the next card in the deck.
